# Wet Felted Wonders

Wet Felted Wonders is a Hungarian small business - located in GÃ¡rdony near Velence lake - producing beautiful wet felted toys. These products are made of soft and beautiful wool (mostly Merino and Bergschaf) with a lot of love and care.

I have decided to make a website for this business as a pet project after completing CodeCool's Fullstack Software Development course. The craftsman of these products is my beautiful wife.
